</h2>

<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Arriving in Muspelheim, it’s time to set out toward the Surtr’s Forge. So, jump across the gap, drop down the ledge, and follow Atreus into the save. Upon entering the cave, loot the Hacksilver pouch that’s on the ground beside the fallen soldier, and then look to the roof to find a Resource bucket hanging from a ledge above.


</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>When dropping down the ledge, you’ll encounter a group of Dodher Wisps. Unfortunately, tied to the Aesir, Dodher Wisps can turn into a trap of Bifrost, which is marked by the red rings on the ground. If you get hit while standing on it, you’ll be inflicted with Bifrost – you’ve been warned.

<h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Dodher Wisp Tips
</h2>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>While Dodher Wisps are around, Einherjar will use them to heal or strengthen themselves in a pinch. So be sure to deal with these Primordial creatures before taking down any Einherjar.
</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>In addition, like other Wisps, if there are enough around, they’ll try and transform into a Wight. So, you must attempt to interrupt them whenever possible.
</p>
    </div>

    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Once you’ve dealt with the Wisps, loot the nearby Legendary Chest to receive 1,000 Divine Ashes, which are used to upgrade equipment to the highest levels. Upon looting the chest, look right, and you’ll discover one of Odin’s Ravens on the other side of the broken wall.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Ready to continue, burn the Red Fungi Bramble and squeeze through the gap in the wall.


</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>On the other side, you’ll encounter a Wight and two Draugr Lords roaming the area – defeat them to continue.

    <h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Draugr Lord Tips

</h2>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Equip with heavy weapons that deal massive amounts of damage upon impact, Draugr Lords are the strongest and heaviest of the lot.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Possessing unique attributes than other Draugr, it’s crucial that you interrupt their charge attacks (blue rings) to avoid taking damage from their powerful special attacks – you can interrupt the attack with a well-timed Shield Strike or Weapon Charge (L1 + Triangle).
</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>With that said, should you fail to interrupt the attack, the Draugr Lord will slam its maul into the ground, sending a large lava-filled quake toward you. Avoid this attack at all costs, as failing to dodge will have you dealt large amounts of damage while also being inflicted with passive burn damage.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>During this particular encounter, we found the best strategy to defeat these Primordial creatures is to kite them around the outskirts area while you focus on taking down the Wight and the Wisps that will spawn.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Due to their slow movements and the large battle area, keeping the creatures at a distance is relatively easy. So, whenever you get a chance, tossing a charged Axe or Draupnir Spear will deal passive damage that will add up over time.
</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>If you’re running low on health, be sure to look around the outskirts of the area, as you’ll find approximately three Healthstones available for you to pick up.

</p>
    </div>

    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Once defeated, pick up any Healthstones and head to the southern ledge, where you’ll find a Hacksilver pouch upon destroying the rock that’s covering it. When you’re ready, shimmy across the ledge beneath the lava waterwall.


</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>From here, follow the path – picking up the Hacksilver pouch beside the fallen enemy left of the gap – until you reach the end.


</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>At the end of the path, you can continue the main path by heading left over the stone ledge or use your Draupnir Spear to break through the wall to your right, where you’ll uncover a Nornir Chest.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>The only Nornir Chest in the Burning Cliffs is found after you slip through a small space and emerge into a trial arena from the 2018 game. Shimmy across the wall under the lavafall, then head downhill to a split.
</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>At the split, you can either go left over a rock column to the next trial arena, or use the Draupnir Spear to blow up the yellow Wind Fissure on the right. Do the latter, and you’ll find the Nornir Chest on the other side in a tiny space.
</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>The N Rune’s torch will be located to the right of the Nornir Chest up the wall of rock.
</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>First, exit back through the opening and make a U-Turn to the right to see a gap where the C Rune’s torch is. Set up an enlarged Hex Bubble chain across the pillars of rock so that you can set them off with a Blazing Surge and light the torch.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Next, return to the Nornir Chest’s spot and look towards the two torches. Set up two enlarged Hex Bubbles on the rocks between the two torches, then fire a third onto the lit C Rune Torch: it will immediately set off the chain and light the R Rune’s torch!

</h2>

    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Much like the Frost Phantom that you faced during The Word of Fate, the Flame Phantom features all the same attacks and moves, but just with flames. Now, the fight with the Flame Phantom is a little longer, as you'll need to find and destroy all three springs that will appear upon successfully filling the creature's stagger bar.
</p>

    <div className='max-w-[600px] mx-auto grid md:grid-cols-1 gap-2 items-center p-2 md:p-4 bg-cyan-900 rounded-lg'>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>That said, the main premise of the fight still remains. Hit the Phantom's core to build stun. Strike when it's glowing to stagger the creature, sending it to the ground and making it vulnerable to stun damage.
</p>
    </div>

    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Once you've filled the core's stun bar, you'll need to destroy the purple glowing Springs that'll appear in the area. Unlike the Frost Phantom, all Springs will be available immediately, so you'll need to down the Phantom at least three times in order to clear them.
</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Spring One: Southeast

    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Spring Two: Southwest

    <h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Tips and Strategies for Defeating the Flame Phantom
</h2>  
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>It's crucial to your success to attack the Flame Phantom's core at every opportunity. The more you can stagger the Phantom, the quicker you'll be able to stun the creature, ending the battle.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>When staggering the Phantom, it'll only be downed for a short period, so you'll want to ensure you constantly recall your Leviathan Axe as quickly as possible after each attack. This way, you'll always have your Axe ready and available when the Phantom is staggered.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>The Phantom's attacks are pretty forgiving in the AoE department, as you'll find that you often have time to toss your Axe at the core before having to dodge out of the way to avoid any incoming attacks.
</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Standing close to the Flame Phantom will offer no advantages and will make you vulnerable to quick melee attacks that are challenging to block. In addition, many of the Phantom's attacks are performed while it is raised in the air, meaning you'll not have access to attack its core with melee.
</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>If you need health, you'll find plenty of Healthstones scattered about the area's outskirts, often beside fallen enemies.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>While the best time to target the Flame Phantom's core is when it's glowing, which occurs when it's performing an attack, don't hesitate to throw your Axe at its standard core, as every bit of stagger damage will ultimately help stun the creature faster.
</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>If you're struggling with health, don't be afraid to run away from its attacks, as most revolve around targeting your last known location.
</p>
    </div>

    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Along with the tips above, we've also covered the creature's entire attack patterns, providing an insight into what you can expect, as well as some tips on how to best counter incoming attacks.

    <h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>The Flame Phantom's Attacks
</h2>  
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Here are all the attacks you'll need to keep an eye out for throughout the battle:
</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Tail Swipe Attack (Block Break) - When standing within melee range, the Phantom will swing its tail toward you in a quick swiping motion.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Orb Toss Attack (Blockable) - When crouching, the Phantom will toss orbs out to your location, indicated by glowing circles on the ground.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Tidal Wave Attack (Unblockable) - Rearing up into the air, the Phantom will form a tidal wave shape, which will see it crashing down into the ground for a significant unblockable AoE attack. Thankfully, this attack can be partially blocked by either of the two stone Springs in the area.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Slam Attack - After dealing melee damage to the Phantom after briefly being stunned, it'll perform a slam attack that will see it crashing down into the ground, creating a small AoE shockwave. The glowing rings around the boss indicate the AoE of this attack.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Shock Wave - Rearing up, the Phantom will crash into the ground, sending a wave of damage your way. You'll need to ensure you're backing up as quickly as possible -- the AoE for this attack is quite large, so you'll need to be very far away to avoid taking damage.
</p>
    </div>

    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>After destroying all the Springs, the Flame Phantom will rise, and you'll need to target its core once more before you can perform the finishing move (R3).


</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Upon defeating the Flame Phantom, you will receive a Healthstone, Ragestone, Shattered Runes, the Vindsvalr's Windstorm Heavy Runic, Luminous Alloy, Bonded Leather, Petrified Bone, and a Frozen Flame weapon upgrade.

</p>

    <h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Reach Surtr’s Forge (Continued)

</h2>

    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Once you’re ready to continue, climb beneath the gap to the east, loot the healthstone beside the fallen soldier, and interact with the nearby wooden pole.


</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Aiming your Draupnir Spear, target the post on the other side of the gap to create a zipline.

</p>

    <h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Approach the Ashen Man

</h2>

    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Having crossed the gap, follow the path up toward Surtr. Entering a short cutscene, Surtr insists that Atreus and Kratos leave him alone before forcefully pushing them down into the area below the anvil.

</p>

    <h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Defeat the Soul Eater
</h2>

    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Upon being pushed down to the ground, you’ll encounter a Soul Eater, who is arguably a Muspelheim Ancient, as its attacks closely resemble that of the Forest and Frost Ancient you fought in previous chapters.


</p>
  <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Now, as you might expect, the main goal of this battle is to build up the creature's stagger bar by targeting its opened chest. Thankfully, each attack offers a brief moment before and after, where its chest is open and not performing any attacks.


</p>
  <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Once you’ve filled the Soul Eater’s stagger bar, it’ll drop to its knees, where you’ll have the opportunity to press R3 to launch a powerful finishing combination by pressing R1 or R2.

</p>
  <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>In addition, throughout the battle, several Draugr Fiends will appear. This Draugr is fast on its feet and will attempt to charge at the soonest opportune moment.


</p>
  <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Due to its speed, hitting this enemy can be tricky, so you’ll want to wait until they rush toward you – indicated by stomping their feet – and then parrying their attacks.


</p>
  <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>While it's entirely up to you, we found it was best to deal with Draugr before attacking the Soul Eater, as their quick movements would often make it a little challenging to get off your attacks without taking damage.

</p>
  <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Also, if you’re running low on health, try defeating the Draugrs to receive some Healthstones, or destroy the vases around the outskirts of the battleground, as you’re guaranteed to receive at least one.

  <h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Soul Eater Attacks and Strategies
</h2>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Now, if you’re looking for even more tips or strategies, here’s what you can expect from each of the Soul Eater’s attacks.

</p>
    <h3 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Fireball Attack

</h3>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Indicating the attack, the Soul Eater will raise its hands across its chest before pushing them down toward the ground, opening its chest.


</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Here, you’ll have a brief moment to toss your Axe or Draupnir Spear into its chest cavity before it unloads a series of fireballs toward you, which can be parried back into its chest when timed just right.


</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Upon each successful parry, the Soul Eater will toss out an ice ball you can pick up and throw at its chest to deal large amounts of stagger.

</p>
    <h3 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Molten Rock Attack
</h3>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Lending backward, the creature will then begin spewing out molten rock in all directions. The Molten Rock attack is limited in range, so standing around the area's outskirts will allow you to toss your weapon into its chest without any major interruptions.


</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Although, if you’re feeling risky, you could opt to head in close as you attempt to parry the incoming molten rocks. Like the fireball attack, any successful parries will see ice balls tossed out. Just note, though, it can be hard to judge the distance and position where the molten rocks will land, so there’s a good chance you could take some damage.

</p>
    <h3 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Shockwave Attack

</h3>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>When standing too close, the Soul Eater will drop onto all fours, unleashing an unblockable shockwave explosion. While its radius is quite small, you’ll want to ensure you’re standing as far away as possible to avoid taking any unnecessary damage.

</p>
    </div>

    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Upon defeating the first Soul Eater, another one will appear. Take it down using the same method and strategy as above.


</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Once defeated, you’ll receive some Healthstones, Ragestones, Hacksilver, Bonded Leather, Shattered Runes, Boon of Fury Amulet Attachment, and a Chaos Flame weapon upgrade.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Now that both Soul Eaters are defeated return to Surtr and watch as a cutscene begins. Despite refusing to join with his wife, Surtr agrees to have Kratos stab him through the heart with his blades, as they possess an ability that might provide the same effect.

</p>

    <div className='max-w-[600px] mx-auto grid md:grid-cols-1 gap-2 items-center p-2 md:p-4 bg-cyan-900 rounded-lg'>
    <h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Surtr’s Forge - Odin’s Raven 1

</h2>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>While you can certainly hear the Raven at Surtr’s Forge, you won’t be able to find the spectral creature until you have spoken to Surtr for the second time. Following the cutscene, look north to the ledge above, and you’ll discover Odin’s Raven perched beneath the archway.

</p>
    </div>

    <h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Follow Surtr
</h2>

    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>When you're ready, follow Surtr as he leads you along the path northeast and through the tunnel.


</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Just before exiting, be sure to head right and loot the Red Coffin to receive some Petrified Bone, Dwarven Steel, and some Hacksilver.


</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Once collected, continue following Surtr as you reach the Spark of the World. Upon jumping over the ledges and grappling across, you’ll find a Healthstone behind a rock to your right.


</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>As you continue forward, you’ll reach an intersection. Take the path right toward Surtr to continue the main story, or continue straight, where you’ll find another Healthstone and a Ragestone. We highly recommend picking these up, as you will need them.


</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Returning to the main path, follow Surtr until you enter a cutscene.

</p>

    <h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Defeat Hrist and Mist - Phase One
</h2>

    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Surprisingly, compared to other bosses you have faced thus far, the Valkyries are quite hittable and rarely perform attacks that block themselves from taking damage.


</p>
   <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>So as long as you're taking your time and making smart combat decisions, defeating the Valkyrie with well-timed hits and parries shouldn't prove too difficult. To top it off, the battle with the Valkyries will last over three phases, each offering a checkpoint.


</p>
   <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Despite having two health bars on display, both Hrist and Mist share the same health. Therefore, any damage dealt to one Valkyrie will be inflicted on the other.

</p>
   <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>So, if you're still curious and want some extra advice, see our tips and tricks below to learn more details about the first phase of the battle.

    <h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Tips for Defeating Hrist and Mist During Phase One
</h2>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>As mentioned above, we've compiled a handy list of tips and tricks that you may find helpful, as well as detailing all of the Valkyrie attacks you'll face during the first phase and how best to counter them below.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>First up, this particular battle relies very heavily on audio cues, as Atreus and the Valkyries will often comment on their impending attacks throughout each phase. One such example is heard when listening to Hrist, as she yells out, "sister." Hrist will use this as a command to have Mist engage in combat, launching an attack upon you.
</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>It's vital that you listen for these small audio cues as they'll offer a significant advantage and allow you to prepare for any incoming attacks you may not see coming.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Typically, throughout the battle, you'll find that Atreus will draw the attention of at least one Valkyrie, with the other only being called upon when commanded.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>When given the opportunity, always unleash as much heavy damage as possible, especially when one of the Valkyries is distracted. With a few well-timed charged hits, you'd be surprised at just how much damage you can inflict.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Throughout the battle, you'll receive Healthstones upon damaging the Valkyrie. You'll want to try and only use these when the Valkyrie are nearby, as their burst will provide a very brief stun to them.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Interrupting attacks and Parrying will sometimes offer Healthstones.
</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>With all that said, here are the attacks you can expect from Hrist and Mist during the first phase of the battle.

</p>
    <h3 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Charge Strike (Yellow Ring)

</h3>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>When yelling “Yield,” Hrist will charge toward you, unleashing a powerful strike. However, with the right timing, you’ll have the opportunity to parry the charge, temporarily leaving Hrist vulnerable to damage.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Another attack variation will occur when Hrist yells “attack,” as this will see her charging toward you when her spear, with Mist, following shortly after. These attacks can be parried, but you’ll need to time them just right to leave them both stunned.
</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>When standing in close proximity, Hrist will begin to protect herself with her wings. Be sure to quickly interrupt this attack with a Shield Strike to avoid taking large amounts of damage from her impending attack.
</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>When standing in close proximity, Hrist will begin to protect herself with her wings. Be sure to quickly interrupt this attack with a Shield Strike to avoid taking large amounts of damage from her impending attack.
</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Successfully interrupting this attack will leave Hrist temporarily stunned, making for the perfect opportunity to unleash high amounts of damage.
</p>
    <h3 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Spear Slam

</h3>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>When standing close, like the Winged Shield Charge, Hrist will quickly fly into the air before driving her spear down into the ground, creating a small shockwave.
</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Do note that during Phase Three, Hrist will perform this attack twice in a row.
</p>
    <h3 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Strike (Yellow Ring)

</h3>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Performing a quick spin, Hrist will unleash a two-spin combination you can block and parry.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>As always, parrying the attack is most ideal, as it'll provide a short moment of stun.
</p>
    <h3 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Spin Attack (Yellow Ring)

</h3>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Charging toward you, Mist will unleash a spin attack in which she uses her wings as a weapon. This continuous spin can’t be parried, but keeping your shield up will block any potential damage. Just be warned; each hit from this attack will push you backward. While you could opt to run and dodge this attack, it does happen to be quite lengthy, so you do run the risk of getting caught with one wrong step.
</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Failing to dodge this attack will see you taking full damage, as you won’t be able to lift your shield, leaving you defenseless as she finishes off her attack.
</p>
    <h3 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Knife Swipe into Knife Throw (Red Ring)

</h3>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>When standing nearby, Mist will perform three swipe attacks at you before quickly spinning into an unblock knife throw.
</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>You’ll need to dodge out of the way or interrupt the attack to avoid taking damage.
</p>
    <h3 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Wing Swipes

</h3>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Often combined with the Spear Slam, Hrist will use her wings as weapons, performing a quick flurry of wing swipes that can be parried.
</p>
    </div>

    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>After dealing enough damage, the Valkyries will heal to almost full health. After a short cutscene, the Valkyrie pair will toss Kratos through the air and over the cliff's edge, where they’ll then grab hold of Atreus.


</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Mashing Circle, help Kratos back up onto the ledge, where he’ll toss his Draupnir Spear at the Valkyries to ensure they let go of Atreus.

</p>

    <h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Defeat Hrist and Mist - Phase Two
</h2>

    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Having saved Atreus, the second phase of the battle will now begin. It is worth noting that this point will act as a checkpoint, so should you die, you'll spawn from this point of the battle.

</p>
 <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Like other bosses throughout the story, the second phase introduces several new attacks you'll need to be cautious of throughout the new phase.

</p>

 <div className='max-w-[600px] mx-auto grid md:grid-cols-1 gap-2 items-center p-2 md:p-4 bg-cyan-900 rounded-lg'>
    <h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Tips For Defeating Hrist and Mist During Phase Two

</h2>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Throughout the fight, keep an eye on Atreus, as the Valkyrie occasionally picks him up, preventing him from assisting with the battle. Thankfully, getting them to let go is relatively straightforward, as sending a single attack in their direction will have him freed.
</p>
    <h3 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Knife and Boulder Throw

</h3>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Standing at the opposite end of the platform, Mist will begin to toss several knives that will home toward you. You’ll need to be quick to block these to avoid taking damage.
</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Do note that should you fail to block this attack, you'll take damage from all the incoming knives, as you will be locked out of using your shield until after all the blades have hit their target.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>In addition, once Mist has finished performing her attack, Hrist will quickly toss a large boulder toward you. This attack can not be blocked, so be sure you're moving as soon as Mist has finished her attack, as taking damage from the boulder will result in significant damage.
</p>
    <h3 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Quake Shockwave

</h3>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Moving to the side of the platform, several large rings will appear on the ground on either side of you. Avoid these red circles at all costs, as the Valkyries will send a damaging quake-like shockwave along the marked area. Then, calling out Tremble, they’ll move to the opposite side and perform the attack once again, so don’t get caught off guard.
</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>You can stop this attack at just one rotation by sending your weapon into one of the Valkyries.
</p>
    <h3 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Charge Attack

</h3>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Like in Phase One, Hrist will begin to charge toward you; however, this time, the attack will be unblockable, so you'll need to dodge out of the way to avoid taking damage.
</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>If you fail to block the attack, you’ll be sent flying into the air before being slammed down and dealt significant damage.
</p>
    </div>

    <h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Defeat Hrist and Mist - Phase Three
</h2>

    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Reaching yet another checkpoint in the battle, the Valkyries will once again replenish their health to almost full. Thankfully, this is the third and final phase of the battle.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Now, there's nothing too notable about this particular phase, as only one new attack is introduced, which is mostly a variation of Hrists original boulder throw from the second phase. Again, parrying and unleashing as much damage as possible, ranged attacks included, will be your primary focus for this phase.

</h2>
    <h3 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Boulder Slam

</h3>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Rising into the air, Hrist will begin summoning a large boulder that she'll then have Mist thrust toward you in an unblockable attack. Thankfully, if you're paying attention, there is typically enough time to interrupt the creation of the boulder with a long-range attack.
</p>
    </div>

    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>After landing enough damage, you’ll be prompted to land a finishing blow. However, this doesn’t go as planned, as the two Valkyrie will target Kratos, sending him to the ground.


</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Just before they kill him, Atreus distracts them by jumping on Mist's back. Then, creating an opening to break free, press L3 + R3 to activate Kratos' Rage state.


</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Doing so will also see Atreus transforming into Bjorn, leading to a vicious sequence of QTE events as the father and son duo take down the Valkyries for good.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Upon defeating the Valkyrie, you’ll receive a Gale Flame weapon upgrade for your Draupnir Spear.

</p>

    <h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Approach the Spark of the World

</h2>

    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Having collected your rewards, follow Atreus back up to the platform and approach the Spark of the World, where you’ll learn that Surtr has transformed into Ragnarok and awaits the call of Gjallarhorn to attack Asgard and take down Odin once and for all.

</p>

    <h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Return to the Mystic Gateway
</h2>

<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Return to the Mystic Gateway
After speaking with Surtr, follow Atreus as he leads you back to Muspelheim.


</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Upon reaching Surtr’s forge, you’ll encounter a group of Einherjar and a Wyvern – defeat them.

</p>

<div className='max-w-[600px] mx-auto grid md:grid-cols-1 gap-2 items-center p-2 md:p-4 bg-cyan-900 rounded-lg'>
    <h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Tips for Defeating the Wyvern
</h2>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>The Wyvern can perform two variants of its lightning attack. The first and most common lightning attack will see the creature tossing two balls of lightning into the air before quickly targeting your location. While you can dodge this attack by swiftly moving sideways, your best option will be to parry the attack, as you can send the lightning back toward the creature, stunning it briefly. This attack is performed twice, so prepare for another onslaught of balls following a very minor break.
</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>The second lightning attack will occur when you’re standing within close range, as the creature will rise above the ground before flapping its wings and sending out a shockwave of electricity. Again, rolling sideways will be your best bet to dodge the attack, but its quick speed makes it quite challenging to parry.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Now, the Wyvern's next attack is arguably the most challenging to perfect the timing, as not only is the charge performed quickly, but its animation is slightly strange as it swoops toward you. If you fail to parry the attack, the Wyvern will grab ahold of you, tossing you into the air before slamming you to the ground – obviously, not the most ideal outcome.
</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>If you do manage to perfect the parry on this attack, you’ll knock the creature to the ground, sending it into a temporarily stunned state, leaving it vulnerable to heavy melee damage.
</p>
    </div>

    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Once defeated, use the newly created ledge that Atreus has pointed out and climb it to the top – along the way, be sure to pick up any Healthstones you may encounter, as you’ll need them.
</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Upon reaching the entrance to Surtr’s Forge, climb beneath the gap in the wall.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>On the other side, you'll have to defeat even more Einherjar forces.


</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Ready to continue, climb over the western ledge and defeat the incoming Draugr and Exploding Nightmare.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Continue following the path forward, shimmying beneath the lava waterfall.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>When entering the large open area, you’ll encounter a Dodher Gradungr that an Einherjar Tamer is controlling.


</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Using similar attacks to the Gulltoppr you faced during Creatures of Prophecy, you'll mostly want to approach the battle similarly by focusing heavily on dodging the incoming attacks and using your weapons to perform long-range attacks.

    <h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Tips for Defeating the Dodher Gradungr
</h2>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>In terms of the Dodher Gradungr's attacks, here is what you can expect:

</p>
    <h3 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Charge Attack

</h3>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Rushing toward you, the Dodher Gradungr will perform a blockable charge attack. While you can opt to dodge sideways to avoid the attack, we found parrying at the right moment provided the perfect opportunity to deal damage as the creature will be tossed to the ground and temporarily stunned.
</p>
    <h3 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Bucking Attack

</h3>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Perform a bucking-bull-like attack; you'll want to Shield Strike the creature to interrupt it. Be careful of your timing when trying to interrupt this attack, as failing to do so will see you get stomped.
</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>However, should you succeed in Shield Striking the creature in time, you’ll temporarily stun it for a brief moment while also disabling its protective shield. This is the perfect time to unleash some quick heavy melee attacks before retreating to safety.
</p>
    <h3 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Quake Attack
</h3>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Slamming its front hooves into the ground, an unblockable quake will ripple toward you. We highly recommend that you dodge out of the way to avoid taking damage from this attack, as it'll leave you stunned for a short moment.e
</p>
    <h3 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Swipe Attack

</h3>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>When standing close to the creature, it'll have a chance to perform a series of melee swipes. While the swipes can be blocked and countered, they are performed relatively quickly, so parrying them can be a bit challenging when caught off guard.
</p>
    </div>

    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>However, before you can start dealing damage, there are a few things you need to know about this particular Dodher Dragungr, as it's quite different from those you have faced in the past.


</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>This Dodher Gradungr is imbued with Bifrost energy in the form of an impenetrable shield that can only be temporarily broken with the aid of Sigil Arrows and striking it with a well-timed Shield Bash.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Without breaking the protection shield, you cannot damage the creature.


</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Once you've broken down the shield, hit the Tamer riding the Gradungr with your Axe or Spear, sending them tumbling to the ground. Not only will this remove the Gradungr's ability to reengage the shield, but the Tamer will also not be able to throw Bifrost orbs at you, and most importantly, they will not be able to heal any damage you that deal to the creature.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Once you've downed the Tamer, you'll want to focus on defeating them. While the Tamer will eventually jump back onto the Gradungr, make it a priority to knock them back down as quickly as possible.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Now, carefully defeat Einherjar Tamer while dodging the Gradungr's incoming attacks.


</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Once you've dealt at least one bar of damage to the creature, watch as more Einherjar forces arrive.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Due to the Einherjar reinforcements that arrive, we highly recommend dealing with the forces before turning your attention back to the Gradungr, as it's much easier to dodge its attacks than to evade several Einherjar that may be targeting you.


</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Once you've cleared the area, head through the crack in the rocks located by Atreus. Climb the ledge and follow Atreus as he leads you back toward the Mystic Gateway that's not too far away.


</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Before climbing the final ledge, though, be sure to destroy the Red Fungi Bramble blocking access to the Red Coffin across the gap to your right, which contains Asgardian Ingot, Dwarven Steel, and some Hacksilver.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Returning to the main path, climb the ledge and use the Mystic Gateway to travel to Tyr's Temple in Midgard, where Freya awaits.
