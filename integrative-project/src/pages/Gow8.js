      <h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Return to the Boat</h2>

      <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'> With the magic chisel in hand, all magically sealed chamber doors are now unlockable - including the one to the side of the giant chisel. </p>
      <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>To do so, you’ll need to find the point to strike over the lock by directing the chisel and then striking where the chisel burns brightest.  </p>
      <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'> In the room beyond, you can spot more of the giant’s clothes forming a wall you can climb. There’s also a Coffin encased in red sap - and if you look behind the frozen clothing you can spot a Shatter Crystal you can knock down to free it netting you a Solid Svartalfheim Steel. </p>
      <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>There’s also a locked gate using Nornir Runes nearby.  </p>
      <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'> Look high above the entrance path you came in from to spot the “C” looking rune. </p>
      <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Now climb the gold studs of the clothing to a high platform to the Dining Room, and look back across to spy the “R” looking rune hiding behind a giant buckle.  </p>
      <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'> Finally, drop down the ledge to the right and move all the way forward and look up above the buckle to spy the “N” looking rune near the top of the pile of ice. </p>
      <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>This will unlock the gate below to a dead Troll that holds a Glacial Catalyst - used to upgrade the Charm of Infinite Storm, an XP stone, and a Hacksilver Chest.  </p>
      <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'> Return to the Dining Hall and be sure to upgrade you Leviathan Axe to level 5 - and purchase any new skills if you need to, or buy/upgrade any armor from your recent spoils, and then head out. </p>
      <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Drop down into the center of the Dining Hall and look for another magically-locked door to break through.  </p>
      <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>You’ll be in a long hall now, and off to the left is a coffin protected by World Tree Sap. Up ahead is a blue crystal receptacle, and turning the corner right you’ll find the crystal trapped by more tree sap.  </p>
      <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'> Take the first left to find a font of Shatter Crystal, and use it to free both the blue crystal, and open the Coffin that contains Solid Svartalfheim Steel. </p>
      <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Now take the blue crystal to the pedestal and activate it to find a Realm Tear, and interact to get Dust of Realms (without having to fight any monsters). Head into the next area to find a port with water in the middle, and an exit under the giant’s thumb on the far side.  </p>
      <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Go to the left first to find a wheel mechanism used to pull a lift across the top, and break the chain that holds it with your axe. Now go right and have Atreus boost up to the lift, and return to the wheel mechanism to send him across the gap.  </p>
      <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Once it’s at the far end, use your axe on the gear above the lift to freeze it in place as Atreus knocks a chain down for you.  </p>
      <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Climb onto the lift and get your axe back to ride it back to the other side. On the right, grab a Hacksilver Chest, then move left towards the exit.  </p>
      <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'> Note that now that you can open the Hidden Chambers of Odin, you can now explore the one near here to find a Jotnar Shrine for Thamur and one of Odin’s Ravens - but more importantly, the chamber leads to a sort of prison that houses a Valkyrie - an incredibly powerful miniboss that may be well beyond your skill at this point. Fight them only at your own risk, or return when you are more powerful. </p>

      <h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Return to Tyr’s Temple</h2>

      <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Heading back on the boat to Tyr’s Temple, you can now explore that magically locked door at the base of the temple that was recently raised.  </p>
      <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'> If you’d rather explore first, you can go back and check out all the Hidden Chambers of Odin you couldn’t explore before - including the ones found in The River Pass, the Foothills, Alfheim, and The Mountain - just remember that the Valkyries inside are not to be trifled with.</p>
      <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>At the base of Tyr’s Temple, run around the platform until you find the magically sealed door to open it using the chisel to hit the three bindings and go inside.  </p>
      <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>As you enter Tyr’s Bridge Interior, take a left to find a Jotnar Shrine about Tyr that’s been tampered with, and a sand bowl riddle in the middle of the room. Atreus will show Kratos how to do it this time - but you’ll be interrupted before the lesson can begin.  </p>
      <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'> After the scene ends, Atreus is in need of some help, and only the Witch can help with this. Hopefully it’s not too late. </p>
