    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Before making your way through the Mystic Gateway, you’ll be stopped by Ratatoskr, who will insist on speaking with you before commencing your journey to Helheim.</p>

    <h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Find Garm in Helheim
</h2>

<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>After receiving a stern warning from Ratatoskr to undo the damage caused by Atreus, head through the Mystic Gateway and travel to Helheim.


</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Running into Garm as you arrive, continue forward, where you’ll spot one of Odin’s Ravens flying in a figure-eight formation just to the left of the wind fissure.

</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>In this area, you’ll also find a hacksilver pouch beside a fallen soldier and a Red Coffin containing Asgardian Ingot, Dwarven Steel, and some Hacksilver when jumping down the ledge right of the wind fissure.

</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Once you’re ready to continue, throw your Draupnir Spear (L2 + R1) into the weak point on the wall and explode it to create some new rock holds on the wall – climb down the wall until you reach the ground below. When reaching the ground below, you’ll encounter a group of Hel-Walkers, including two new variants of these creatures.

</p>

<div className='max-w-[600px] mx-auto grid md:grid-cols-1 gap-2 items-center p-2 md:p-4 bg-cyan-900 rounded-lg'>
    
<h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Hel-Shadows</h2>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Hel-Shadows defend themselves with a magical ice wall. If you miss them with an Axe throw, recalling it right into their backs is an evergreen tactic.</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Their ice walls can also damage us, exploding if we get too close. Best if we try to deal with these nasties from a distance.</p>
<h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Hel-Shadow Archers</h2>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Their projectiles are quick (and sharp) but won’t leave you stunned. If you rush these Archers, you may take them out of the fight early.</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Arrow attacks are reliable means of disrupting their attack pattern.</p>

</div>

<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Look over to the iced-over wall from the top ledge, and use your Draupnir Spear to target and explode the three wind fissures found across the chunk of ice. Upon detonating the spears, two Hel-Walkers will arise from the rubble – defeat them and collect any Healthstones before continuing up the wall.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Follow Atreus a short distance, where you’ll find another Healthstone and a Hacksilver chest before being prompted to climb beneath the gap in the wall.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Upon reaching the other side of the small tunnel, you’ll encounter a Realm Tear allowing Hel-Walkers to travel between the realms. You’ll need to close this Hel-Tear to continue.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Much the Hel-Tear that Atreus helped Freya close at Sindri’s, you’ll need to fend off and survive an onslaught of Hel-Walkers that range from Hel-Reavers, Hel-Shadow, and Hel-Archers for a short period of time, indicated by the countdown timer at the top of the screen.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>While everyone has their own approach, we found Kratos’ Blades of Chaos shine in situations like this. Not only does their AoE make keeping enemies at bay much easier, but the ability to pull enemies in and ignite them while slamming them into the ground, temporarily stunning them, truly sets the weapon above the Leviathan Axe. Especially in situations where the core gameplay is built around overwhelming the player.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Upon successfully closing the Hel-Tear, you’ll unlock the Hel to Pay Favor and receive a Frozen Spark, Essence of Hel, Hacksilver Dust of Realms, and the Axe Attachment, Grip of Healing Harmony. Before traversing the gap, loot the area for any Healthstones and Hacksilver pouches that the Hel-Walkers may have dropped.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>On the other side, interact with the gate and have Atreus Hex Arrow the first ringed symbol, followed by the last one above the entrance. Once the symbols are Hex’d, use the wheel to raise the gate fully, and then throw your Axe at the first symbol – this will see the frost effect transfer between the Hex bubbles and onto the symbol covered by the gate.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>After freezing the gate, quickly head through it before the freeze effect wears off.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Upon reaching the other side, you’ll encounter three more Hel-Walkers – take them down.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Now, before continuing, turn toward the gate and grapple up the ledge, where you’ll find a Hacksilver chest to loot. Once looted, continue following Atreus as he runs ahead.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Watching as Garm tears apart the realm, you’ll soon be attacked by a group of incoming Ice Nightmares and Hel-Walkers – defeat them.


</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Once defeated, climb down the southern ledge, and continue a short distance ahead, where you’ll encounter several Hel-Walkers emerging from the end of the path you’ll need to defeat.

</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Upon clearing the area, look north, and you’ll spot a Wind Vent on a large stone pillar beneath the bridge – these are marked by yellow glyphs. After creating the makeshift rod, return to the ledge above – defeating yet another group of Hel-Walkers along the way – and swing across the gap.


</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>On the other side, you’ll need to fend off more Hel-Walkers – be sure to utilize your Shield Strike and Spartan Kick to knock the Hel-Shadows off the edge of the bridge – before you can open the Legendary Chest to your left.


</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>This chest contains the Tame the Beast Heavy Runic Attack for the Blades of Chaos. Pound-for-pound, it’s the strongest Heavy Runic Attack for the Blades available thus far in the game.

</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>After looting the chest, continue following Atreus to the end of the path. Before jumping down the ledge, collect the Hacksilver pouch beside the fallen enemy. Then, jump down the ledge and help Atreus up the wall, where he’ll break the nearby latch, providing you with a way up.


</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Continue up the wall, where you’ll come face-to-face with Garm for the first time. Immediately following the cutscene, you’ll encounter a powerful level 5 Hel-Viken. To break through the Hel-Viken’s protected health bar, we recommend using your Blades of Chaos as the creature is weak to fire – performing your Runic Abilities should see the bar deplete.

</p>

<h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Hel-Viken Tips and Tricks
</h2>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>When it comes to dodging the Hel-Viken’s attacks, it’s recommended that you dodge horizontal swings backwards, and then vertical swings sideways.

</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>When missing its overhead attack, its mace will get stuck in the ground, leaving it vulnerable for a short time.
</p>
    </div>

    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>With limited space in the area, be sure you’re constantly moving around to avoid the Hel-Viken’s damaging ice swipe, which will see you becoming affected by ice should you fail to block it.
</p>

<h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Pursue Garm</h2>

<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Once you’ve dealt with the Hel-Viken, it’s time to pursue Garm as he retreats further into Helheim. So, squeeze through the gap in the wall and jump down to the ground below. Before continuing forward, loot the Hacksilver chest to your right and grapple across the gap ahead.
</p>

<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Not too far ahead, you’ll encounter two Hel-Raiders that’ll come rushing toward you. While they may have protected health bars, a well-timed parry can send them tumbling off the ledge, disposing of them quickly. Once defeated, jump across the gap and then down the next ledge.


</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Follow the path forward – looting the Hacksilver pouch beside the fallen soldier – until you reach the Hel-Traveler blocking the gate forward.

</p>

<div className='max-w-[600px] mx-auto grid md:grid-cols-1 gap-2 items-center p-2 md:p-4 bg-cyan-900 rounded-lg'>
<h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Hel-Traveler Tips and Tricks

</h2>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Hel-Travelers are more aggressive than their living counterparts – they’ll charge right at you, leaving you little time for effective ranged attacks.</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Whittle down their armor by staying close and dodging their strikes. But, when he charges up his overhead smash or sword charge, you’ll want to stay as far away as possible.</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>While the Hel-Travelers sword is glowing, this is when he is most deadly, as his quick movements and transitions between his overhead smash, sword stab, and quick sword swipes can quickly end in death if you’re not prepared to dodge out of the way. While you can dodge and roll backwards, we found the most effective method to dodging attacks was rolling sideways.</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>The most effective way to defeat the Hel-Traveler is with your Blades of Chaos. Not only can you inflict burn damage, but their heavy attacks also deal quick significant damage, especially considering that their armor deflects most of your melee combat.</p>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Lastly, when the Hel-Traveler stops and raises his hand into the air, you’ll want to use your Axe to destroy the glowing orb he’s holding to deal stagger damage, creating the perfect opportunity to get in close with some quick melee attacks.</p>
    </div>

    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Upon defeating the Hel-Traveler, you'll receive a Frozen Flame upgrade for your Axe. Now, collect any Healthstones in the area and then interact with the large wooden wheel.
</p>

<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Unable to keep the gate open, you’ll need to use Atreus’ Hex arrows to freeze the gate open.
</p>

<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>To do so, have Atreus place three Hex arrows along the exposed wooden beam, then open the gate fully, leaving just one Hex bubble exposed. Now, freeze the exposed Hex bubble with your Axe and quickly get beneath the gate before the Hex effect wears off.
</p>

<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Ready to continue, loot the Red Coffin to your left to receive Petrified Bone, Stonewood, and some Hacksilver. As you follow Atreus along the path, pick up the Hacksilver pouch found to your left by a dead enemy. Then, drop down the ledge and continue through the small passage on the other side and up the ledges.</p>

<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Then, continue forward and climb over the stone pillar – here, you’ll be attacked by two level 4 Hel-Raiders with protected health bars. The best way to defeat these Hel-Raiders will be with your Blades of Chaos.

</p>

<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>After defeating them, pick up any Healthstones and head into the crawl space to the west to find a Hacksilver pouch. Once collected, take the short path northeast, where you’ll find a Wind Vent on the other side of the gap – throw your Draupnir Spear into it to create a swing point that you can use to cross the gap.


</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>After swinging across the gap, loot the Resource pouch by the fallen enemy along the way. Eventually, you’ll reach a Legendary Chest that contains the Thrust of a Thousand Soldiers, a Light Runic Attack for the Draupnir Spear. While equal to the Mountain Splitter in terms of damage, it leaves spears in the target, which you can then detonate with the Triangle Button for even more damage!

</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Ready to continue, squeeze through the gap in the wall and shimmy across the ledge, where you’ll encounter Garm as he tears apart even more of Helheim.


</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>As Garm continues to flee, drop down the ledge and defeat the Hel-Shadow Archers and Hel-Raiders that’ll attack. Once defeated, continue following the path and climb over the stone pillar as you attempt to get closer to Garm.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Entering a short cutscene, Atreus will transform into his wolf form and attempt to distract Garm while Kratos grabs ahold of his chain. But, to do so, you’ll need to freeze the nearby end of the chain with your Axe. Once frozen, pick up the chain, where you’ll enter another cutscene before Garm flees again.
</p>

<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>With Garm fleeing, follow the path right and open the door. Continuing left, you’ll encounter a group of Hel-Brood – take them down. Then, jump across the gap, and pick up the Hacksilver chest to your right.
</p>

<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Continuing forward a short distance and you’ll discover a Wind Vent. Unfortunately, you won’t be able to reach it from where you're standing. So, to get a better angle, destroy the nearby crates and vases and continue around the other side. Here, throw your Draupnir Spear (L2 + R1) into the vent to create a rod you can swing on to reach the ledge above.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Upon doing so, you’ll encounter a group of Ice Nightmares, a Hel-Revenant, and several Broods – take them down. Once the area is clear, pick up any Hacksilver pouches and Healthstones left behind. Now, continue following the path north – don’t forget to shoot down the Resource bucket hanging above the ledge for some Shattered Runes.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Navigating forward, grapple to the large stone pillar and continue toward Garm, where you’ll eventually enter a cutscene.
</p>

<h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Defeat Garm

</h2>

<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Despite Atreus’ best efforts to tame Garm, it’s now time to take him down for good. Comprised of ten sectioned health bars, Garm is no joke, so plan for the long haul because this fight will take quite a bit of time and patience.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Now, while not overly tricky, Garm requires you to practice patience, as there are select times when it’s best to attack him, with most relying heavily on parries and general melee attacks.
</p>

<div className='max-w-[600px] mx-auto grid md:grid-cols-1 gap-2 items-center p-2 md:p-4 bg-cyan-900 rounded-lg'>
<h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Tips and Tricks for Defeating Garm
</h2>
    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>While ranged attacks such as throwing your Axe and Atreus’ Bow and Arrow will deal minor amounts of damage, it’s not significant enough for us to recommend, especially if there’s a chance you could take damage.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>The length of Garm’s Ice Shockwave can be somewhat deceiving, so if it’s not safe to try and roll out of danger, opt to block the incoming wave with your shield.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>When Garm is downed, unleash everything you’ve got – this includes Spartan Rage and Runic Abilities – as this will be one of the main opportunities to damage the Hel-Hound.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>Once you’ve fully depleted six of Garm’s health bars, you’ll unlock a checkpoint, so any deaths following, you can expect to spawn back at this particular point of the fight.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-2 mb-2'>As the fight nears a close, be prepared to dodge attacks, as Garm will begin attacking quicker and chaining more attacks together.

</p>
    </div>

    <p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Straight out of the gate, Garm will perform his first major attack, which sees him rearing into the air before slamming his front paws into the ground, sending a shockwave of ice in your direction. Now, this attack is blockable, so unless you’re absolutely certain that you’ll escape without taking damage, we suggest you block this attack, as the shockwave's length can be somewhat deceiving.
</p>

<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Following the ice shockwave, Garm will lunge forward with an unblockable attack as he attempts to bite you. To best avoid this attack, roll out of the way just before he reaches you. So, after dodging the attack, prepare to parry the head swipe he’ll quickly perform. Doing so will leave him temporarily stunned and vulnerable to all incoming attacks for a brief moment.
</p>

<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>While downed, this will be your opportunity to unleash as much damage as possible, so consider using your Spartan Rage and Runic Abilities to deal heavy damage.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Now, if you don’t manage to parry the attack, it’s not the end of the world, as if you’re quick, you’ll have the chance to hit him before he begins to retreat – hitting him once will trigger the same effect as the parry.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Once you’ve dealt two full health bars worth of damage, Garm will introduce three new attacks to his arsenal.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>To get started, he’ll perform an unblockable attack that sees him whipping his chain toward you before it temporarily becomes lodged into the ground. After lodging into the ground, use your Axe to freeze the end of the chain. Once frozen, pick up the chain and watch as Garm is dragged down to the ground – here, you’ll have the opportunity to unleash significant damage to him, so bring out all stops!
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Nearing approximately half health, Garm will begin whipping his chain around several times before he finally slams it into the ground, so be wary of this slight variation as you near this point of the fight.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>In addition, Garm will perform a new variation of the Ice Shockwave attack, as he’ll slam his front paws down three different times, causing three different waves of ice to barrel toward you. Like before, either parry and block this attack or dodge out of the way if it’s safe.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Finally, Garm will spit two balls of ice toward you. Unfortunately, this attack is unblockable, so you’ll have no choice but to dodge the incoming rocks.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Once Garm has just four health bars left, you’ll enter a brief cutscene that seems him climbing up along the edge of the arena before unleashing several deadly, new attacks. Now, it’s important to note that this will act as a checkpoint, so any deaths following this point, will be restarted from here.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>With that said, while on the edge of the arena, Garm will unleash a slight variation of the ice ball projectiles you just experienced. Instead, this one is much more dangerous, as he’ll spit out a slew of ice balls rather than just two, so you’ll need to be quick to dodge out of the way continually.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>When Garm is ready to jump down, a large red ring will appear on the ground – you’ll want to avoid this, as standing within the circle will deal significant damage. That’s not all, though, as upon hitting the ground, he’ll send a large, unblockable shockwave toward you that you will need to roll through to dodge.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>As you near the end of the fight, repeat the steps mentioned above until you fully deplete his health bar – just be warned, as the battle nears its end, Garm will begin to perform attacks much quicker!
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Finally, once you’ve dealt enough damage, you’ll have to freeze and grab Garm’s chain one final time. After a brief cutscene, Kratos and Atreus will require you to mash Circle and Square when prompted to end the fight.
</p>

<h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Leave Helheim
</h2>

<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Having, unfortunately, killed Garm, continue south and climb the wall. Pick up the Healthstone by the rubble and then continue down the stairs, where you’ll find a Hacksilver chest to your right.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>A short distance ahead, you’ll come across another puzzle gate and a Legendary Chest sitting along the right side of the wall. This chest contains the Onslaught Shield, which has Kratos Shield Rush enemies when you Double Tap the L1 button. If Kratos charges a certain distance, then he’ll launch enemies into the air on impact.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>If you also got the Shatter Star Shield in The Abandoned Village in Vanaheim, this is the last shield you need to find for the Phalanx Trophy! However, if you still haven’t gotten this Trophy, you may not have purchased the Dauntless and/or Stone Wall Shield from Brok and Sindri.
</p>

<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Once you’ve looted the Legendary Chest, it’s time to solve the gate puzzle. So, to open the gate, interact with the large wheel and then have Atreus Hex the stone weight on the right. Next, turn the wheel until the stone weight on the right is in line with the blue and yellow latch. Once in line, have Atreus Hex the stone weight on the left to create a chain effect.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Now, quickly throw your Axe at the stone weight on the left, and watch as the gate will be frozen open – you’ll need to move quickly beneath the gate to avoid it becoming unfrozen.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>On the other side, follow Atreus – pick up the Healthstone by the fallen enemies along the way – and open the door. Upon opening the door, you’ll enter a cutscene that reveals Garm is still alive.
</p>

<h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Run! (Defeat Gram - Part 2)</h2>

<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Following this revelation, Kratos and Atreus will need to escape the crumbling ruins of Helheim as Garm is determined to stop them from leaving. With Garm unleashing attacks, you’ll need to follow Atreus as he leads you through a nearby hole in the floor – keep following Atreus, taking down Broods, and other Hel-Walkers along the way.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>You'll enter another short cutscene when grappling across a gap in the path. With Garm blocking the path, you’ll find yourself trapped in the small room. To continue, you’ll want to target the weak points on Garm's leg with your Draupnir Spear. After tossing some spears onto Garms leg braces, detonate them by pressing Triangle – this attack will deal over two health bars worth of damage.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>During this, Garm will perform minor swipes and a smaller version of the Ice Shockwave, so keep an eye on those before aiming in with your spear to avoid damage.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>With Garm fleeing, continue across the gap before you run into Garm once again. He'll toss an Ice Ball at you this time, sending you through the floor below. From here, continue forward, taking out the Broods that’ll charge toward you,
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Break through the wooden boards and grapple to the ledge above, following Atreus toward the Mystic Gateway. On the way back, you’ll be intercepted by Garm.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Finding yourself in a much smaller arena, you’ll need to defeat Garm again. Now, this part of the battle plays out mostly the same as your earlier encounter, as Garm will use all the same attacks, and you’ll want to use the same strategy of hitting and stunning Garm as he comes in close for attacks.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>However, instead of unleashing heavy melee attacks once he’s stunned, you’ll want to equip your Draupnir Spear and use it to target the Gold Metal Braces found on his legs and around his neck. Upon targeting these, detonate your embedded spears to deal heavy damage to Garm.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>You’ll want to repeat these steps until his health bar is depleted – or so you thought, as he’ll regenerate his health once more.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>During this final stage, Garm will introduce a new attack that sees him slamming his front paws into the ground, creating an area-wide shockwave you’ll need to roll to avoid.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Now to finish off the fight, you’ll want to drop Garm to the ground for a total of two times, where you’ll then be prompted to press R3 to latch onto his collar, followed by mashing Circle while Atreus attempts to climb up onto his back in one final, last-ditch effort to tame the creature.
</p>

<h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Keep Pursuing Garm
</h2>

<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>With Garm fleeing once more, Atreus will convince Kratos to continue pursuing Garm, as he’ll reveal that he placed Fenrir’s soul into Garms, hoping it’ll change his nature.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Wanting to see if Fenrir’s soul took, follow Atreus through the gap in the wall and drop down the ledge on the other side.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Continue traveling up the ledges that lead north and then climb the wall at the end of the path. Once you reach the top, drop down the ledge and jump across the gap. Then, climb along the ledge until you reach Garm, where you’ll enter another cutscene.
</p>

<h2 className='border-b border-gray-500 max-w-full text-4xl text-white'>Return to the Mystic Gateway
</h2>

<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Following the heartwarming scene, it’s time to return home. To do so, grapple up the ledge and follow Atreus down the path until you reach another puzzle gate.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>To solve the puzzle, interact with the large wooden wheel and have Atreus Hex the bottom of the stone cog by the gate.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Once Hex’d, turn the wheel halfway and Hex the bottom half of the cog to create a chain effect. Now, throw your Axe and watch as the gate freezes open – be sure to head through the gate quickly to avoid it unfreezing.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Upon heading through the gate, look directly in front of you to discover a Lore Marker and one of Odin’s Ravens above.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Now, before continuing left, be sure to head right – collecting the nearby Hacksilver pouch along the way – where you’ll encounter an optional conversation with Hraesvelgr, a large Eagle, who will inform you to close the six realm tears that have been scattered about the realms.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Following the conversation, return to the Lore Marker and continue left, jumping down the ledge. From here, turn right to find a Mystic Gateway – you’ll need to press R2 to clear it from the rubble. Once clear, you’ll enter a short cutscene with Atreus and Kratos as they talk about the mistakes they have made.
</p>
<p className='text-white text-xl mt-10 mb-10'>Once you’re ready, return to Sindri’s house and head inside, where Atreus will show his findings from visiting Asgard – this will conclude the mission.
